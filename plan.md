To do list

Create a To do list that has different level of priorities

Users can add items to the list and choose the level they want those items to have
Users can add items to specific dates/times
Users can also set alarms/alerts for specific items
Users can delete items from the list temporarily or permanently even if not done
Every time an item is ticked off the list you get an inspirational/motivational quote
Users can check their progress on a progress bar
